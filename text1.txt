Thanks for Professor Cong’s excellent speech. My name is Gong Baiyu. In this part, I’d like to share my perspective on MBTI and explore the right ways to understand it.
MBTI is a self-report questionnaire designed to categorize individuals into 16 distinct "psychological types" based on various traits. 
From Professor Cong’s talk, we learned that MBTI results may change over time. Beyond the reasons already discussed, I’ like to introduce an additional concept that might explain this phenomenon—self-elasticity.
Self-elasticity refers to our flexibility and adaptability in exercising self-control. This concept, which originates from Freud’s theory of defense mechanisms for coping with anxiety, measures how we adjust and respond to life’s challenges. 
I believe self-elasticity is also an individual trait, but it isn’t included in the MBTI framework. People with higher self-elasticity tend to have more adaptable characteristics. As a result, they might get different MBTI results over time.
Actually, MBTI is just a test model to look at certain parts of our personality. It can not reflect our personality comprehensively. After all, there are billions of unique individuals in this world; How is it possible to define us by a few letters?
I always think that everyone is unique and can not be defined. Of course, we can't deny that MBTI can help us understand ourselves better. It is a good tool that helps us to explore our Inner world. But today, what I want to say is that we can not be constrained by MBTI. Remember, your MBTI result is meant to inspire your personal growth and an improved understanding of yourself and your relationships. Do not take it as gospel. 
So don’t worry about that why my MBTI results change. We are far more complex and dynamic than what MBTI test can capture. Let’s keep a normal mind and celebrate our unique personality. 
Thank you very much.
